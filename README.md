This project runs a bicycle simulator running with a monitor and a modified
stationary bicycle interface.

The software consists of 3 parts:
 - A Unity3d game/project that runs on a computer that runs the game engine and
   simulates the bicycle dynamics.
 - An arduino project that reads various sensors and actuates the haptic motor.
 - A python layer that interfaces between the game and embedded device.
